* The code was fairly easy to understand and write but only some things caused minor problems including error checking and making the art look good. In this lab, I learned how to effectively error check, code testing, and utilize functions. I started with creating each function for the 3 types of ASCII art and then proceeded to make the main function. after creating most of the code I realized that io had to prevent if the user inputs a non-valid input and a value that would run but not properly. After that, I tested the code and everything else went well.
